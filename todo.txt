1. consider 1password op integration
2. consider executing shell scripts that pull git repos like dotfiles etc...
  instead of maintaining a separate config in this repo
3. set workdir 
4. install gnu stow
5. maybe do multi stage build? clone repo and  do gnu stow wet the workdir and then copy that over to the final r image?
